OpenLFConnect is a Python and sg3_utils based replacement application for the LeapFrog LFConnect
program. For Explorer and LeapPad it can use their dftpdevice to upload firmware. It also manages
uploading the surgeon.cbf file for USB boot recovery mode and is capable of enabling sshd on both
devices. For Didj it can mount the USB drive, copy firmware over, and send the eject command that
will attempt to start flashing the firmware.

WARNING: This program attempts to flash new firmware, has the ability to make and delete, upload
and download, files could be destroyed, firmware flashing could go wrong. There is no prompts for
second chances.

Check OpenLFConnect/doc/INSTALL for installation and configuration.


Build Log:
Version 0.9.0
    Adding DFTP4 Functionality
    Minor fixes
    	initramfs.py GZIP sig works with v2 surgeon now
        fixed dftp/2 device_name complaint int/str
    Mount ubi changed for version 2 firmware, requires kernel 2.6.37+ hack though :(
        perhaps later kernel support for chip as of 3.7 no

Version 0.8.0
    Fixed repopulation of files/ directory when started outside of application root.
    Fixed Image mounts not check if path exists
    Made Image mounts print mount path on mount
    Added some is_empty checks for commands requiring arguments
    Created a cfg file parser for figuring out the DFTP numbers
    Tried to make entire app more friendly to starting outside root, can ln -s in usr/bin/ now

Version 0.7.5
    Added extract initramfs from Surgeon
    Fixed package_download to work in current directory

Version 0.7.4
    Added Bulk_empty up/download for Lpad and Explorer
    Fixed ubi_mount where it would only except erootfs
    Fixed packages.py to use unused function for name checking
    Added DIDJ Emerald Boot updating

Version 0.7.3
    Added path complete with 1 or 2 arguments ahead of it on the cli
    Changed cbf/ubi/jffs2 create commands to utilize these and dropped erootfs from names
    Fixed error with building LeapPad kernel kernel_jump/load wrong
    Added ubi_create bulk, undetermined on adding to firmware update LF package is basically empty

Version 0.7.2
    Cleaned up dftp/didj firmware formatters
    Fixed some help text.

Version 0.7.1
    Added jffs2/ubi erootfs mount/umount/create functions
    Found issue with didj firmware, patched a bit for now

Version 0.7
    Reworked Firmware updates with some new automagic
    Created olcmodules/config.py file for holding olc vars like device name
    Added start up function to build files directory and copy scripts over

Version 0.6.5
	Centralized debug prints
	changed debug_on debug_off to debug on|off was nearly exact same code for both
	Minor clean up from sync issue
	Cleaned up/download code, removed file_check,dir_check
		each function_i deals with it again.
		cleared out redundant checks
	Added some nicer formating to ls, up/download

Version 0.6.4
	Finally got the sync/corruption issue figured on on Didj
		Removed unmount, as corruption seemed almost a given using it.
		Along with it having limited usage.
	Changed upload/download to work with files or directories
	Fixed regex bug in mount.py
	Added regex to find_mount as no drive letter was causing issues.

Version 0.6.3
	Added modules for firmware handling
	Added package download function
	Changed local client to file sync on upload, prevents didj ejecting before cache is flushed. 
	
Version 0.6.2
    Found the RUN command, which runs a shell script. Works much like upload RUN > data > 101 EOF
    Removed enable ftp/sshd/telnet, rcS file is too important, should be done during Surgeon boot,
        with patient rfs mounted.
    Added Mount Patient 2 mounts rfs, 1 mounts bulk/rfs, 0 unmounts any.
    Wrote some basic shell scripts for RUN, start|stop ftp/telnet/sshd/patch_sshd_config
    Removed local path getting reset on remote_destroy()
    Fixed reboot was missing \x00 from raw send and added reboot_usbmode.
    
Version 0.6.1
	Changed dftp downloads/cat/uploads to have functions that up/downloads to/from a buffer
	Changed from enable sshd to ftp and telnet, was an easier, more universal patch, requires no ssh
	   program on Windows
	Used d/upload buffer to change how enabling is done, d/l to buffer, change string, upload from
	   buffer.
	Renamed dftp_send to send, and made it a direct raw call and receive.

Version 0.6
	Added functions for wrapping and unwrapping CBF files
	made a firmware module for CBF Packages, LX firmware functions
	light code clean up, and bug fixes.

Version 0.5
	General code organization, testing, fixes.
	Found issues with install dependencies, Windows requires Bonjour to be installed.
	Removed anything not in standard python 2.6 install on Linux or Windows, afaik.
	Changed is_connected to check eth or mount, ping was too slow.
	Disconnected in session issues fairly well taken care of now.
	Moved all the local/remote/path to locations.py.
	Added package extractor.
	Added LX firmware rename.
	Added device info outputs.
	
Version 0.4
	Changed is_connected() to actually ping the device
	Added windows search for host IP, no need for default or static (1.25min wait though)
		as it will default to a zeroconfig 169.254.x.x
	Added some cmd do_<command> checks to prevent commands running if no meant to be.
	Started a debug feature, for added output and test runs on updates, printing, instead of flashing
	Added cat command for printing files to console
	Determines name from board id, instead of firmware version now


Version 0.3
	Added experimental LeapPad Update/sshd enable
	Added functions for determining device name, firmware version, dftp server version
	Added functions to set firmware version, and dftp server version
		  these are used to determine which firmware to upload, Explorer style or LeapPad
	Formated help text better

Version 0.2
	General code clean up and simplification and continuity.
	Fixed local.py/get_device_id to work with out the udev rule in Linux
	Fixed local.py/get_mount_path added time out feature, to wait while mount point is being created
	OpenLFConnect.py/get_abspath changed from path_format, and simplified greatly
	OpenLFConnect.py/path_completion simplified the code
